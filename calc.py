# This file provides a simple command-line calculator, 
# with implementations of important mathematical functionalities.
#
# The implementors must fill the empty functions (all of them!)
# with the right code. Also, there are some functions specified only in comments, 
# without their declarations, so one should declare 
# and implement them.
#
# All functions must be properly documented.
